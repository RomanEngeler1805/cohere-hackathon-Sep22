I took him to PetSmart but they said they couldn't groom him because he was to afraid of the noise of the clippers. I read this one was quiet so I purchased this. It makes noise but not as much as other clippers, and the hair comes off very easy. He let me groom him, it didn't come out perfect but it was my first time, I'm sure with practice it will be better. I also used it on two of my dogs (medium sized white terrier mix and medium size wolfhound mix) and the hair also came off easily, no cuts or anything.

Surprisingly I found this Phoebe mouth guard for my grinding teeth, which can save me a lot of money, and to be honest I did not have high expectation in the beginning but the price is so good for me then I decided to have a try, and never thought it could work so well to stop the damage from teeth fringing! Here are some tips of what I have done as below: 1. Drop the mouth guard into the hot water. (one piece at a time), and just lightly hot warm water. 2. Use a wooden spoon to scoop the guard in the hot water and shake off all hot water. 3. Grab the guard and place it on the row of teeth you are molding. Use the indention in the center of the guard to line it up with the center of your row of teeth. 4. Once it is in your mouth, close your mouth and begin to suck in--almost as if there is food stuck on your teeth that you're trying to remove without a toothpick. Also, while you're doing that, press down your lips towards your teeth to give it an extra help to mold to the front of your teeth. Use your tongue to get inside in place. 5. Keep the guard in your mouth until you feel it firm up. It'll probably take a minute or so to set. In addition, there are 3 packs with optional sizes to choose from, it was slightly tricky to get it to perfectly set comfortably on my teeth. But that is fine--if you don't get it the first time you can always try to reset it by dunking the pieces back into the hot water. By the 2nd (or 3rd) it should be pretty easy to get it exactly the way you want to be.",works well for me,en,beauty

I have used these in two different high quality adult coloring books. A Johanna Basford and a Leila Duly book. Both of these books have very small spaces that requires precision. These are listed as pens, but in my opinion they are more like a fine line marker. The cons: some of the pens are very dry, so that they scratch and skip over the paper which results in patchy looking coloration. The Caps and stoppers at the bottom of each pen appear to be color coded. However, the pen color is drastically different from the color indicators. I included a picture of some swatches I did for the greens. Colors G6 to GO are just Small example, but most of the pen caps do not match the ink color The dryer pens are impossible to blend or build color. Also, if one runs out of ink I don't see a reliable way to replace it, none of the pens have a color name or code. And I haven't seen a listing for individual pens. Pros: the ones that are on the wetter side will blend beautifully with practice and skill. I'm not that skilled, but I was able to get a couple of nice blends. The case they come in is a sturdy and a good travel size. For 20.00 there were a good range of colors.",Requires advanced skill level,en,office_product
